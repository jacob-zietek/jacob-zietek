I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major @ Purdue University. My main interests are in applications using Computer Vision, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning. I'm more generally interested in any AI R&D :^)

I'm currently working on common-sense reasoning in robotics and interacting with AI in a casual ways at Purdue University's CoRAL Laboratory.

Please email me to look at my private repositories ðŸ˜„ jzietek:zap:purdue.edu
