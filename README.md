# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major @ Purdue University. My main interests are in applications using Robotics, RL, and NLP. I'm more generally interested in any AI R&D.

The most up to date descriptions of my work can be found on my [website](https://jacobzietek.me/) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-zietek/).

Currently part-time at a Stealth Startup, and a research assistant at both Purdue's CoRAL Laboratory and AKRaNLU Laboratory.

I'm currently working on
- Stealth Startup: Super secret AI stuff, maybe AI things on the side
- CoRAL Laboratory: Interacting with robots through natural language
- AKRaNLU Laboratory: Task-oriented multimodal conversational agents for the [Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge 2](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/taskbot-challenge/ten-university-teams-selected-for-alexa-prize-taskbot-challenge-2)
