I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major @ Purdue University. I'm currently an intern at Amazon working with Applied Scientists on ML R&D. My main interests are in applications using Computer Vision, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning. I'm more generally interested in any artificially intelligent system, particularly ones that utilize machine learning :^)
