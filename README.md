I'm an undergraduate Computer Science major @ Purdue University. My main interests are in applications using Robotics, NLP, and Reinforcement Learning. I'm more generally interested in any AI R&D :^)

The most up to date descriptions of my work can be found on my [website](https://jacobzietek.me/) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-zietek/).

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at CoRAL Laboratory and ARKaNLU Laboratory at Purdue University, where I am working on interacting with robots through natural language and task-oriented multimodal conversational agents respectively.

Please email me to look at my private repositories ðŸ˜„ jzietek:zap:purdue.edu
